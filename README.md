policy_wonk
========

PolicyWonk is a lightweight authorization and resource loading library for any Plug or Phoenix application. [Authorization (Auth-Z)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authorization) is the process of deciding what a user/entity is allowed to do _after_ theyâ€™ve been authenticated.


## Setup

Add `policy_wonk` to the deps section of your application's `mix.exs` file

```elixir
defp deps do
  [
    # ...
    {:policy_wonk, "~> 0.2"}
    # ...
  ]
end
```

Don't forget to run `mix deps.get`

## Plugs

PolicyWonk provides three main plugs.

* `PolicyWonk.LoadResource` loads resources into the conn's assigns map. 
* `PolicyWonk.Enforce` evaluates a specified policy. It either continues or halts the plug chain depending on the policy result.
* `PolicyWonk.EnforceAction` evaluates a policy for each incoming controller action in Phoenix.

Decisions are made before controller actions are called, isolating authorization logic, encouraging policy re-use, and reducing the odds of messing Auth-Z up as you develop your controllers.

In a router:

      pipeline :browser_session do
        plug PolicyWonk.LoadResource, :current_user
        plug PolicyWonk.Enforce, :current_user
      end
      
      pipeline :admin do
        plug PolicyWonk.Enforce, {:user_permission, "admin"}
      end

In a controller:

      plug PolicyWonk.Enforce, {:user_permission, "admin_content"}
      plug PolicyWonk.EnforceAction
